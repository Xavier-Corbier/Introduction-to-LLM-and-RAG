### Lab: Building a Classification Pipeline Using a Generative AI

**Objective**  
The goal of this practical work is to build a sentiment classification pipeline using a generative AI and leveraging the dataset available on Kaggle: [IMDB Movie Ratings Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/imdb-movie-ratings-sentiment-analysis). You will experiment with tailored prompts to produce consistent and usable outputs in JSON format.

### General Guidelines

1. **Purpose of the Assignment**  
   Design a pipeline that:  
   - Accepts a text input (excerpts from movie reviews).  
   - Generates a sentiment classification (positive or negative) using a generative AI.  
   - Returns the response in a structured **JSON** format.

2. **Optional Evaluation**  
   Once the pipeline is built, you can evaluate its quality by comparing its predictions with the true labels in the dataset.

3. **Customization Encouraged**  
   This assignment is intentionally open-ended: you are encouraged to explore different approaches and demonstrate creativity.

### Resources to Assist You

To succeed in this assignment, consider researching and familiarizing yourself with the following concepts:  
- **Python**: for data manipulation and interacting with APIs.  
- **JSON**: to structure outputs in a standardized format.  
- **Prompt Engineering for Classification**: to design prompts tailored to your task.  
- **Dataset Handling**: using tools like Pandas and NumPy.  
- **Model Evaluation**: metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Tips

- **Iterate Quickly**: Test your prompts frequently and adjust them based on the results.  
- **Be Methodical**: Start with simple examples before generalizing to the entire dataset.  
- **Handle Unexpected Scenarios**: Prepare your code to manage cases where the AI produces unexpected responses.  
- **Explore AI Tools**: Some generative models perform better than others for specific tasks. Experiment with different providers if necessary.
