### Lab: Setting Up a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System for Technical Documentation

**Objective**  
In this lab, you will build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to query technical documentation, such as [this example](https://python-docs.project.erios.ai/). Sources may include:  
- [PyTorch Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/docs)  

The goal is to design a system that:  
1. Stores and indexes documents in a vector database.  
2. Enables users to ask questions and retrieve relevant passages.  
3. Generates precise answers using a generative AI model based on the retrieved passages.

### General Guidelines

1. **Documentation Sources**  
   You may choose one or more of the following sources:  
   - Online Python documentation.  
   - PyTorch documentation available in the GitHub repository. Download it locally by cloning the repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.git
     ```  
     The documentation files are located in the `docs/` directory.

2. **Lab Goal**  
   Build a pipeline that integrates:  
   - **Extraction**: Collecting and preprocessing documentation files (e.g., converting `.rst` or `.md` files into plain text).  
   - **Indexing**: Creating a vector database to search for relevant passages.  
   - **Retrieval and Generation**: Using retrieved passages to generate precise answers with a generative AI model.

3. **Explore Freely**  
   You are encouraged to experiment with different tools, libraries, and techniques, such as **re-ranking** or using various vector databases.
