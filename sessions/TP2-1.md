client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.mistral.ai/v1/",  
    api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your API key
)

# Define the assistant's behavior and user input
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "YOU ARE AN AGENT!"},  # Initial system instruction
    {"role": "user", "content": "Give me an idea to become rich."}, 
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="your_model",  # Replace with your chosen model
    messages=messages,  # Pass the conversation context
    stream=False  # Wait for the full response
)

# Extract and print the assistant's response
ai_response = response.choices[0].message.content
print(ai_response)
```

### **Step 2: Select an AI Model**
1. Go to the **Models** section in GroqCloud.
2. Choose a model such as:
   - **LLaMA (Meta)**
   - **GroqGPT**
   - Other supported open-source models.

### **Step 3: Obtain an API Key**
1. Subscribe to the free plan.  
2. Create an API key.  
3. Choose a model.  

### **Step 4: Integrate the API into Your Application**
Here is a Python example for using GroqCloud:

```python
from openai import OpenAI  # Import OpenAI module for API interaction

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",  # Replace with your API endpoint
    api_key="your_api_key",  # Replace with your API key
)

# Define the assistant's behavior and user input
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "YOU ARE AN AGENT!"},  # Initial system instruction
    {"role": "user", "content": "Give me an idea to become rich."}, 
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="your_model",  # Replace with your chosen model
    messages=messages,  # Pass the conversation context
    stream=False  # Wait for the full response
)

# Extract and print the assistant's response
ai_response = response.choices[0].message.content
