### General Guidelines

1. **Choice of Tools and Technologies**  
   You are free to use any combination of tools and libraries suitable for your project.

2. **Expected Outcome**  
   A web application where:  
   - The user can enter a question or a message.  
   - The application responds using a generative AI.  
   - The interface is intuitive and offers a smooth user experience.

3. **Exploration and Learning**  
   You will need to independently research how to integrate a generative AI into your application (e.g., using an API like OpenAI). There are multiple ways to accomplish this task—be creative and experiment.
