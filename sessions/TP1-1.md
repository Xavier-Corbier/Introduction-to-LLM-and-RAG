### **Lab: Exploring Prompt Engineering Techniques**

#### **Objectives:**
- Understand the principles of prompt engineering.
- Discover and practice techniques for crafting effective prompts.
- Observe the impact of prompt variations on generated responses.

---

### **General Instructions:**
1. Read each section carefully.
2. Follow the steps in the activities and record your observations.
3. Test your prompts in a text-generation tool powered by an LLM (e.g., Copilot).
4. Compare the responses obtained to better understand the effects of adjustments in your prompts.

### **Activity 1: Define a Personality and an Audience**

#### **Objective:**
Explore how personality and target audience influence the model’s responses.

#### **Steps:**
1. Write a prompt where the model acts as an art history expert.
2. Test these variations:
   - A pedagogical expert.
   - A popularizer.
   - A formal lecturer.

#### **Sample Prompt:**
> "You are an expert in art history. Explain the Italian Renaissance to a teenage audience."

#### **Observation Questions:**
- How do tone and structure change across variations?
- Which variation seems most suitable for a teenage audience? Why?

---

### **Activity 2: Specify Output Format**

#### **Objective:**
Learn to guide the model in structuring its responses.

#### **Steps:**
1. Ask the model to provide "5 steps to resolve a workplace conflict."
2. Test the following variations:
   - Present the steps as a numbered list.
   - Explain the steps in a narrative paragraph.
   - Add a concluding summary of the key points.

#### **Sample Prompt:**
> "Provide 5 steps to resolve a workplace conflict in a concise list format."

#### **Observation Questions:**
- Does the model follow the formatting instructions?
- Which format do you find the clearest and most useful? Why?

---

### **Activity 3: Targeting the Action**

#### **Objective:**
Learn to direct the model’s responses toward a specific goal.

#### **Steps:**
1. Ask the model to explain "supervised learning."
2. Test the following variations:
   - Add a request for a concrete example.
   - Limit the response to under 50 words.
   - Tailor the explanation for high school students.

#### **Sample Prompt:**
> "Explain supervised learning using a simple analogy for high school students."

#### **Observation Questions:**
- Did the model follow your specific instructions?
- Which variation produced the most accessible and comprehensible response?

---

### **Activity 4: Handling Specific Scenarios**

#### **Objective:**
Anticipate and specify how the model should respond in specific situations.

#### **Steps:**
1. Ask the model to recommend books on creativity.
2. Add clauses to handle the following cases:
   - If the model doesn’t know of any books, suggest blogs or videos.
   - If the request concerns a child, recommend age-appropriate books.

#### **Sample Prompt:**
> "Recommend books on creativity. If none are available, suggest blogs or online videos. If the request is for a child, recommend age-appropriate materials."

#### **Observation Questions:**
- Does the model correctly address the scenarios you specified?
- What additional instructions could improve the response?

### **Conclusion**

1. **Quick Summary:**
   - Did you observe significant differences in responses based on prompt variations?
   - Which techniques do you find most useful? Why?

2. **Further Applications:**
   - Consider other situations where these techniques could be applied, such as drafting emails, creating educational content, or solving specific problems.

### **Optional: Extra Exercise**

Reformulate this initial, vague prompt:  
> "Explain artificial intelligence."

To make it more precise and effective, applying the techniques learned in this lab.
